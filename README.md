This project allows the monitoring of the temperature of my raspberry pi

A python script running on my raspberry is collecting the temperature every hour. This project uses this data and displays graphs

Technologies used : React-Js, Chart-Js, react-chartjs-2, Python (to create the json file which contains the data to process)
